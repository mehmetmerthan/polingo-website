# Personal Dictionary Website

The **Personal Dictionary Website** is the web-based counterpart of the mobile app and web extension. Users can access their personalized dictionary, manage words added from various sources, and learn more about their vocabulary in detail. The website is built using **React** and **AWS Amplify** for a reliable, responsive experience.

## Features

### 1. **Personal Dictionary**
On the website, users can view the words theyâ€™ve added through the mobile app or web extension. Here they can:
- Review detailed information about the words (definitions, translations, etc.)
- See a list of words marked as "learned" and track their learning progress

### Integration with Mobile App and Web Extension
The words saved via the **Web Extension** and **Mobile App** are automatically synchronized across all platforms. This integration makes it easy to keep track of the vocabulary added in any of the apps.

## Technology

- **React**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces, ensuring smooth navigation and rendering.
- **AWS Amplify**: A cloud-powered backend that supports user authentication, database management, and real-time data synchronization.
